# Android-Certificate-Pinning-Bypass-Script
This repository contains a Frida script designed to bypass or re-pin certificate pinning in Android applications. Certificate pinning is a security mechanism used by applications to verify that the server's SSL certificate presented during the TLS handshake matches a predefined certificate or set of certificates. The script loads a custom Certificate Authority (CA) certificate from a file, adds it to a KeyStore, initializes a TrustManagerFactory with the KeyStore, and hijacks the SSLContext.init method to replace the default TrustManager with a custom one. This effectively bypasses or re-pins the certificate validation process, allowing for analysis of network traffic and identification of potential vulnerabilities in Android applications.
